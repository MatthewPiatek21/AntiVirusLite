# Antivirus Cybersecurity Software Project

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a functional and effective antivirus software solution that can protect personal computers and small business workstations from various types of malware threats. The software will be built primarily using Python, leveraging open-source libraries and tools to provide core antivirus functionality.

## Key Features
### 1. Real-Time Malware Scanning
1.1. The software will continuously monitor the file system and running processes, detecting and preventing the execution of known malware signatures.
1.2. It will use file hash matching, behavior analysis, and heuristic-based detection techniques to identify potential threats.
1.3. Detected threats will be automatically quarantined to prevent further system infection.

### 2. Scheduled Scans
2.1. Users will be able to configure the software to periodically scan the entire file system for potential threats on a scheduled basis (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
2.2. Scheduled scans will utilize the same detection techniques as the real-time scanning engine.
2.3. Scan results will be presented to the user, along with options to remove or restore quarantined files.

### 3. Malware Definition Updates
3.1. The software will automatically download and apply the latest malware definition updates from a centralized source (e.g., VirusTotal, malware research repositories).
3.2. Updates will be scheduled to run at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly) to ensure comprehensive protection against new and evolving threats.

### 4. Quarantine and Removal
4.1. When a malware threat is detected, the software will automatically quarantine the infected file(s) to prevent further system infection.
4.2. Users will be provided with options to remove the quarantined file(s) or restore them if they are identified as false positives.
4.3. The quarantine system will maintain a history of all detected and quarantined threats.

### 5. Lightweight and Efficient
5.1. The software will be designed to have a minimal impact on system performance, utilizing efficient algorithms and libraries to maintain low resource consumption.
5.2. It will use multi-threading and asynchronous processing techniques to ensure real-time scanning and updates without slowing down the host system.
5.3. Maximum memory usage should not exceed 256MB during normal operation and 512MB during full system scans
5.4. CPU usage should remain below 5% during real-time monitoring and below 30% during full system scans
5.5. Full system scan should process at least 1000 files per second on standard hardware
5.6. Real-time monitoring latency should not exceed 100ms for file operations

### 6. User-Friendly Interface
6.1. The software will provide a clean, intuitive user interface that allows users to easily configure settings, view scan results, manage quarantined files, and access the malware definition update history.
6.2. The interface will be developed using a lightweight Python GUI library, such as `tkinter` or `PyQt`, to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

### 7. Cross-Platform Compatibility
7.1. The software will be developed to be compatible with multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, to reach a wider user base.
7.2. This may involve the use of cross-platform libraries or the creation of separate builds for each platform.

### 8. Performance Monitoring and Reporting
8.1. Real-time performance metrics tracking:
     - Scan speed (files/second)
     - Memory usage trends
     - CPU utilization
     - Disk I/O impact
8.2. Weekly performance reports generation
8.3. Automatic throttling when system resources are constrained
8.4. Performance optimization suggestions based on usage patterns

### 9. System Health Monitoring
9.1. Monitor critical system resources:
     - Available disk space (minimum 1GB required)
     - Memory availability
     - CPU temperature and usage
9.2. Automatic adjustment of scan intensity based on system health
9.3. Alert user when system resources are critically low
9.4. Maintain system health log for troubleshooting

## Technical Approach
### 1. Python-Based Core
1.1. The core functionality of the antivirus software will be implemented using Python, leveraging popular libraries such as `os`, `hashlib`, `subprocess`, `shutil`, and `concurrent.futures` for efficient file system interaction and multi-threading.
1.4. Implement comprehensive error logging with the following severity levels:
     - CRITICAL: System-level failures requiring immediate attention
     - ERROR: Component-level failures affecting specific functionality
     - WARNING: Potential issues that don't affect core functionality
     - INFO: Normal operational events
     - DEBUG: Detailed debugging information
1.5. Implement automatic recovery procedures:
     - Automatic service restart on critical failures
     - Database rollback capabilities for corrupted updates
     - Automatic quarantine backup system
     - Failsafe mode for core scanning functions

### 2. Malware Signature Database
2.1. The software will maintain a database of known malware signatures, which will be regularly updated from a centralized source (e.g., VirusTotal, malware research repositories).
2.2. The database will be stored in a compact, efficient format (e.g., SQLite, custom binary format) to ensure fast lookups during real-time and scheduled scans.
2.3. Database updates must be digitally signed using RSA-2048 encryption and verified before installation
2.4. Quarantine storage must use AES-256 encryption for all isolated files
2.5. Local signature database must be integrity-checked at startup using SHA-256 hashing
2.6. Delta updates should be implemented to minimize bandwidth usage during definition updates

### 3. Threat Detection and Mitigation
3.1. The software will utilize a combination of techniques for detecting and mitigating threats, including:
  - File hash matching against the malware signature database
  - Behavior analysis of running processes to identify suspicious activities
  - Heuristic-based detection of unknown or zero-day malware threats

### 4. Automated Update Mechanism
4.1. The software will include a mechanism to periodically check for and download the latest malware definition updates from the centralized source.
4.2. Updates will be applied automatically, ensuring that users are protected against the most recent threats.
4.3. The update process will be designed to be seamless and transparent to the user, with minimal interruption to the software's operation.

### 5. Lightweight User Interface
5.1. The user interface will be developed using a lightweight Python GUI library, such as `tkinter` or `PyQt`, to provide a clean and intuitive experience for users.
5.2. The interface will include features for configuring scan settings, viewing scan results, managing quarantined files, and accessing the malware definition update history.

### 6. Cross-Platform Compatibility
6.1. The software will be designed to be platform-independent, with a focus on supporting the major desktop operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
6.2. This may involve the use of cross-platform libraries or the creation of separate builds for each platform, ensuring that the software can be easily installed and used by a wide range of users.
